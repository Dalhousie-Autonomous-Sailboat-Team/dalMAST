For advanced users only.

The sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED() macro is called from within the Free\+RTOS APIs when data is sent to a message buffer or stream buffer. If there was a task that was blocked on the message or stream buffer waiting for data to arrive then the sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED() macro sends a notification to the task to remove it from the Blocked state. x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Send\+Completed\+From\+ISR() does the same thing. It is provided to enable application writers to implement their own version of sb\+SEND\+\_\+\+COMPLETED(), and MUST NOT BE USED AT ANY OTHER TIME.

See the example implemented in Free\+RTOS/\+Demo/\+Minimal/\+Message\+Buffer\+AMP.\+c for additional information.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Stream\+Buffer} & The handle of the stream buffer to which data was written.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Higher\+Priority\+Task\+Woken} & $\ast$px\+Higher\+Priority\+Task\+Woken should be initialised to pd\+FALSE before it is passed into x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Send\+Completed\+From\+ISR(). If calling x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Send\+Completed\+From\+ISR() removes a task from the Blocked state, and the task has a priority above the priority of the currently running task, then $\ast$px\+Higher\+Priority\+Task\+Woken will get set to pd\+TRUE indicating that a context switch should be performed before exiting the ISR.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If a task was removed from the Blocked state then pd\+TRUE is returned. Otherwise pd\+FALSE is returned. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
