Post an item to the front of a queue. The item is queued by copy, not by reference. This function must not be called from an interrupt service routine. See x\+Queue\+Send\+From\+ISR () for an alternative which may be used in an ISR.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Queue} & The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.\\
\hline
{\em pv\+Item\+To\+Queue} & A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the queue. The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from pv\+Item\+To\+Queue into the queue storage area.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Ticks\+To\+Wait} & The maximum amount of time the task should block waiting for space to become available on the queue, should it already be full. The call will return immediately if this is set to 0 and the queue is full. The time is defined in tick periods so the constant port\+TICK\+\_\+\+PERIOD\+\_\+\+MS should be used to convert to real time if this is required.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+TRUE if the item was successfully posted, otherwise err\+QUEUE\+\_\+\+FULL.
