 Creates a new stream buffer using statically allocated memory. See x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create() for a version that uses dynamically allocated memory.

config\+SUPPORT\+\_\+\+STATIC\+\_\+\+ALLOCATION must be set to 1 in \mbox{\hyperlink{_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h_source}{Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h}} for x\+Stream\+Buffer\+Create\+Static() to be available.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Buffer\+Size\+Bytes} & The size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by the puc\+Stream\+Buffer\+Storage\+Area parameter.\\
\hline
{\em x\+Trigger\+Level\+Bytes} & The number of bytes that must be in the stream buffer before a task that is blocked on the stream buffer to wait for data is moved out of the blocked state. For example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 1 then the task will be unblocked when a single byte is written to the buffer or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. As another example, if a task is blocked on a read of an empty stream buffer that has a trigger level of 10 then the task will not be unblocked until the stream buffer contains at least 10 bytes or the task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires. If a reading task\textquotesingle{}s block time expires before the trigger level is reached then the task will still receive however many bytes are actually available. Setting a trigger level of 0 will result in a trigger level of 1 being used. It is not valid to specify a trigger level that is greater than the buffer size.\\
\hline
{\em puc\+Stream\+Buffer\+Storage\+Area} & Must point to a uint8\+\_\+t array that is at least x\+Buffer\+Size\+Bytes + 1 big. This is the array to which streams are copied when they are written to the stream buffer.\\
\hline
{\em px\+Static\+Stream\+Buffer} & Must point to a variable of type Static\+Stream\+Buffer\+\_\+t, which will be used to hold the stream buffer\textquotesingle{}s data structure.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If the stream buffer is created successfully then a handle to the created stream buffer is returned. If either puc\+Stream\+Buffer\+Storage\+Area or px\+Staticstream\+Buffer are NULL then NULL is returned.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Example use\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}

// Used to dimension the array used to hold the streams.  The available space
// will actually be one less than this, so 999.
\#define STORAGE\_SIZE\_BYTES 1000

// Defines the memory that will actually hold the streams within the stream
// buffer.
static uint8\_t ucStorageBuffer[ STORAGE\_SIZE\_BYTES ];

// The variable used to hold the stream buffer structure.
StaticStreamBuffer\_t xStreamBufferStruct;

void MyFunction( void )
\{
StreamBufferHandle\_t xStreamBuffer;
const size\_t xTriggerLevel = 1;

    xStreamBuffer = xStreamBufferCreateStatic( sizeof( ucBufferStorage ),                                                xTriggerLevel,                                                ucBufferStorage,                                                \&xStreamBufferStruct );

    // As neither the pucStreamBufferStorageArea or pxStaticStreamBuffer
    // parameters were NULL, xStreamBuffer will not be NULL, and can be used to
    // reference the created stream buffer in other stream buffer API calls.

    // Other code that uses the stream buffer can go here.
