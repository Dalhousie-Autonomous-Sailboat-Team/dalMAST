INCLUDE\+\_\+x\+Task\+Resume\+From\+ISR must be defined as 1 for this function to be available. See the configuration section for more information.

An implementation of v\+Task\+Resume() that can be called from within an ISR.

A task that has been suspended by one or more calls to v\+Task\+Suspend () will be made available for running again by a single call to x\+Task\+Resume\+From\+ISR ().

x\+Task\+Resume\+From\+ISR() should not be used to synchronise a task with an interrupt if there is a chance that the interrupt could arrive prior to the task being suspended -\/ as this can lead to interrupts being missed. Use of a semaphore as a synchronisation mechanism would avoid this eventuality.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Task\+To\+Resume} & Handle to the task being readied.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+TRUE if resuming the task should result in a context switch, otherwise pd\+FALSE. This is used by the ISR to determine if a context switch may be required following the ISR. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
