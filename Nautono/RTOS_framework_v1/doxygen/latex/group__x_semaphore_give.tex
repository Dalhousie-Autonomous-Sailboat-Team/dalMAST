\begin{DoxyPre}xSemaphoreGive( SemaphoreHandle\_t xSemaphore )\end{DoxyPre}


{\itshape Macro} to release a semaphore. The semaphore must have previously been created with a call to x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Binary(), x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Mutex() or x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Counting(). and obtained using s\+Semaphore\+Take().

This macro must not be used from an ISR. See x\+Semaphore\+Give\+From\+ISR () for an alternative which can be used from an ISR.

This macro must also not be used on semaphores created using x\+Semaphore\+Create\+Recursive\+Mutex().


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Semaphore} & A handle to the semaphore being released. This is the handle returned when the semaphore was created.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\+TRUE if the semaphore was released. pd\+FALSE if an error occurred. Semaphores are implemented using queues. An error can occur if there is no space on the queue to post a message -\/ indicating that the semaphore was not first obtained correctly.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Example usage\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
SemaphoreHandle\_t xSemaphore = NULL;

void vATask( void * pvParameters )
\{
   // Create the semaphore to guard a shared resource.
   xSemaphore = vSemaphoreCreateBinary();

   if( xSemaphore != NULL )
   \{
       if( xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore ) != pdTRUE )
       \{
           // We would expect this call to fail because we cannot give
           // a semaphore without first "{}taking"{} it!
       \}

       // Obtain the semaphore -\/ don't block if the semaphore is not
       // immediately available.
       if( xSemaphoreTake( xSemaphore, ( TickType\_t ) 0 ) )
       \{
           // We now have the semaphore and can access the shared resource.

           // ...

           // We have finished accessing the shared resource so can free the
           // semaphore.
           if( xSemaphoreGive( xSemaphore ) != pdTRUE )
           \{
               // We would not expect this call to fail because we must have
               // obtained the semaphore to get here.
           \}
       \}
   \}
\}
